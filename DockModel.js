// CONTEXT.md). No Quickshell or QML imports, so the exact same file loads
// as a JS import inside the shell and via `require` under Node for the
// test suite.
//
// Placed positions (CONTEXT.md "Placed"; docs/SPEC.md "Ordering" and
// "Input"): every Item carries a stable `key` ("pin:<appId>" for a Pin
// Item, "window:<windowId>" for a Window Item). `placements` is an
// optional array of `{ key, index }` recording the absolute slot a drag
// dropped that key at; `buildDockItems` applies it as a final pass over
// the Launch-Order/Pin-slot arrangement below, via `applyPlacements`. A
// Placed Pin's `{ key, index }` is meant to be persisted (DockConfig.js)
// so it survives a restart; a Placed Window Item's is meant to be kept
// only in memory for as long as its Window stays open — buildDockItems
// itself doesn't care which, since a placement whose key matches nothing
// currently on the Dock (a closed Window, a Pin not currently shown
// because its App has Windows) is simply ignored, which is exactly what
// lets a Placed Pin's slot reassert itself the moment its bare Pin Item
// reappears. DockConfig.js's "placeItem" intent computes the next persisted
// `placements` for the drag gesture (which lives in Service.qml).
//
// A Window is `{ id, class, workspace, openedAt, title, active, attention }`.
// `openedAt` is a monotonically increasing value (timestamp or counter)
// recording when the Window appeared; it is what Launch Order sorts by.
// `title` is passed through onto the Item for the Quickshell side's
// tooltip; the model itself has no use for it. `active` is true for the
// Active Window (CONTEXT.md); `attention` is true while the Window is
// requesting Attention. Both default to falsy when omitted. `resolveApp(window)`
// returns the matching App (an object with at least an `id`) or a falsy
// value when the Window's App cannot be identified.
//
// `pins` is the Dock's persisted Pins list (CONTEXT.md "Pin"): an ordered
// array of App ids, each holding a slot at its index. `resolveAppById(id)`
// resolves a Pin's own App id directly (as opposed to `resolveApp`, which
// resolves a Window's App from its class) and returns a falsy value when
// that App is no longer installed. Both `pins` and `resolveAppById` are
// optional; omitting them (as every pre-Pins caller does) reproduces the
// exact Launch-Order-only behaviour from before this ticket.
//
// A Pin's slot holds its own Window Items — in Launch Order among
// themselves — for as long as its App has any open Windows, and falls
// back to a single Pin Item (CONTEXT.md "Pin") the moment it doesn't. Pins
// occupy the Dock's leading slots in their persisted order; every Window
// belonging to an unpinned App follows in Launch Order, exactly as
// buildDockItems ordered every Window before Pins existed.
