# What StartBar's tours share (scripts/tours/*.sh source it): the sandbox they run in, the Dock they start with, and a few helpers
# for finding things in it. A tour file sets what is its own (TOUR_OUT, TOUR_STEPS, ...) and defines tour_play.
#
# The tour runs in a nested session (scripts/nested/session.sh): its own Hyprland and Omarchy shell, with this checkout as the
# plugin, in a home of its own, behind a guard that refuses the Start menu's power commands. Nothing of yours is touched, and
# the recorder proves it (TOUR_REAL_UNCHANGED).
#
# The Dock starts from the state the README's pictures show: icons on the left, the theme's colours, the built-in Start menu, previews
# on, no clock, no badge, no auto-hide, and these Pins. The Pins are apps installed on the machine that records; tour_requires says
# which one is missing.

# The plugin, its sandbox and what a recording must not change are in devkit.conf.
