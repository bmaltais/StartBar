// An App's icon, as an Image source, for the Dock and the Start menu
// (docs/SPEC.md "What the Dock shows"). Quickshell.iconPath(name, true)
// remembers a miss until the shell restarts, so an icon installed after its
// App was first looked up (a package installed while the shell runs) would
// stay blank. On a miss this searches the icon directories itself
// (DockIcons.js builds the command and picks the file) and hands back the file
// it finds; until then, or if there is none, source() is "" and the caller
// draws its fallback. One instance serves everything that draws icons, so a
// name is searched for once however many places show it.
//
// `files` is name -> path and, like `tries` and `last`, is reassigned and
// never edited in place, so a binding that called source() updates.
